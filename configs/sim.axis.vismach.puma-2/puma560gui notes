in standard build:
after editing the puma560gui python file for vismach, sudo cp it to /usr/bin
after editing the vismach.py file, sudo cp it to /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/

in run-in-place build:
after editing the puma560gui python file (vismach machine definition), copy it to /linuxcnc-fanucdev/src/hal/user_comps/vismach/
after editing the vismach.py file, copy it to /linuxcnc-fanucdev/lib/python 

editing vismach.py at line 1031 (t.far = size * 10.0 edited to 100.0) stopped the model disappearing in the viewport, making the true-size model viable. 

colours for vismach - values seems to be [r,g,b,a] - some examples:
black - ([0,0,0,0])
grey - ([0,0,0,0.5])
blue - ([0,0,1,1]
green - ([0,1,0,1]
red - ([1,0,0,1]
yellow - ([1,1,0,1]

changing DH parameters in genserkins.h - edit it here:/home/freemoore/linuxcnc-fanucdev/src/emc/kinematics/
then recompile just that: in that directory (I think...) do:
cd linuxcnc-dev/src
make ../bin/genserkins.h - crap. this seems to have worked once, and now doesn't. 
in /linuxcnc-fanucdev/src, ran ./autogen.sh then ./configure and it seemed to rebuild lcnc...?

it looks like the z and x axes in fusion 360 are swapped for the purposes of part alignment re the Dh parameters: drawing robot parts with Z being axis of rotation and X being axis of translation (as they appear in fusion) leads to them being 90deg wrong in vismach
