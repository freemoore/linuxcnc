encoder goes 2400 pulses per stepper revolution
commanding 90 degrees gets about 150deg/170 deg

the wheel has 72 teeth
it moves 1 tooth per stepper rev
360/72 is 5

so 1 rev goes 5 degrees
2400 pulses per 5 degrees
480 pulses per degree then?
yes!

so steps per degree...
step scale just now is 200
but driver is set to on off off, or 800 
(unless it's off on on, which is 400)

so 800 steps per 5 degrees
gives 160 steps/deg
but 220 steps/deg seems to be working so it's that for now.
