something about creating a new 'pumagui'...we are working with the puma560 setup
referenced by this file in fanucstepper hal
loadusr -W puma560gui

pumagui is in /usr/bin/
to copy fanucSteppergui there, open terminal in desktop and use: sudo cp fanucSteppergui /usr/bin/

puma.xml sets joint limits (for sim?)

check what kind of obj file vismach needs to see - ascii, but that seems to be the only kind of obj file

now looking at editing /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/vismach.py
edited fanuc.xml to reflect fanuc's real joint ranges of motion

re-editing DH parameters according to http://linuxcnc.org/docs/2.8/html/motion/dh-parameters.html

RIGHT.
so on an otherwise untouched puma560 sim config, changing only the DH parameters causes the 'kinematicsInverse failed' error to happen 

it loads the component: puma560gui

edited genserkins.h to match dh parameters from fanucsteppers.hal

right. 

looks like you need to compile linuxcnc from source to try world mode (altered kinematics).
do 'locate genserkins' to see the few places it exists; in this file.h you can change the default DH parameters
compiled according to these instructions:
https://github.com/LinuxCNC/linuxcnc/blob/master/docs/src/code/building-linuxcnc.txt

consider setting HOME = 0 0 0 0 0 0 in TRAJ as per linuxcnc.org/docs/2.7/html/config/ini-config.html
and later in same document: POSITION_FILE = position.txt for keeping track of position when switched off

this is the system we are running at the moment: freemoore@fanucpc:~/linuxcnc-fanucdev$ linuxcnc /home/freemoore/linuxcnc/configs/FanucSteppers/FanucSteppers.ini

(consider changing DH value  of 6th joint to a mm length, for tooltip 
according to researchgate post 'what is modified DH parameters' - the difference between DH/modDH is that one set describe the origin of the following frame, the other the origin of the previous frame?
