; andy edited to simplify behaviour, now goes up to machine z0, probes down 
; sets G54 z to be the toolsetter trip height and then lifts it a short distance. 
; intended to be used once per manual tool change

; safety move to z max height

; probe down 3mm from current position to toolsetter fast
g38.2 z-50 f300 
; probe up to release fast
g38.4 z1 f150 
; probe down 1mm from current position to toolsetter slow
g38.2 z-3 f50 
; probe up slowest

;next line should be active for when 63.55mm tall toolsetter is placed on top of work at z=0
;G92 Z63.55
;alternate for when toolsetter is fixed to bed: set g92 offset to be 63.55-(fixture+work height)
;in river lane front panel case fixture is 49mm high,  work height is 6mm, offset is 49+6=55mm, 
;set 0 to 63.55-55=8.55
;in river lane rear panel case work is 4mm, 63.55-53=10.55
;so for 6mm thick stock:
;G92 Z8.55
;for 4mm thick stock:
;G92 Z10.59
;for fixture = 3.2, work = 2.05, fixture+wqork = 5.25, offset = 63.55-5.25 = 58.3
;for fixture = 3.2, work = 3.20, fixture+wqork = 6.4, offset = 63.55-6.4 = 58.3
