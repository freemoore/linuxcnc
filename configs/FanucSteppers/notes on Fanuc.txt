something about creating a new 'pumagui'...we are working with the puma560 setup
referenced by this file in fanucstepper hal
loadusr -W puma560gui

pumagui is in /usr/bin/
to copy fanucSteppergui there, open terminal in desktop and use: sudo cp fanucSteppergui /usr/bin/

puma.xml sets joint limits (for sim?)

check what kind of obj file vismach needs to see
